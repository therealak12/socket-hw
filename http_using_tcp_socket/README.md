<br /><br /><br /> 


Specifically, your Web server will (i)
create a connection socket when contacted by a client; (ii) receive the
HTTP request from this connection; (iii) parse the request to determine the specific
file being requested;(iv) get the requested file from the serverâ€™s file system; (v)
create an HTTP response message consisting of the requested file preceded by
header lines; and (vi) send the response over the TCP connection to the requesting
client.
